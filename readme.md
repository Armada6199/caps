# CAPS

## In lab 11 I have made an application that is like talabat ,I connected between vendors which need someone to deliver their orders and a driver which needs some orders to work, each time there is a new order  the main hub will emit a new event to the ddriver to notify him to go pick up the order ,when the driver picks up the order it will notify the system that the items is picked up ,then when the order is in traniste the drdiver will notify the system and sends the pickup date,then when the driver drops off the order it will notify the system and the vendor will send a thanks letter for the driver with the order id
